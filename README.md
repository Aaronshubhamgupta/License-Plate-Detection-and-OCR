# License-Plate-Detection-and-OCR

Overview

License Plate Detection and OCR is a Streamlit application that uses OpenCV and Tesseract OCR to extract license plate numbers from images. The app utilizes preprocessing techniques to enhance image quality and a robust contour detection algorithm to identify license plate contours.

Features

- License plate detection and extraction using OpenCV
- OCR functionality using Tesseract OCR
- Preprocessing techniques to enhance image quality
- Robust contour detection algorithm to identify license plate contours
- User-friendly Streamlit interface for uploading and processing images

Usage

1. Upload an image of a license plate to the app
2. The app will detect and extract the license plate number
3. The extracted text will be displayed on the screen

Technology Stack

- OpenCV for image processing and contour detection
- Tesseract OCR for optical character recognition
- Streamlit for building the user interface

Requirements

- OpenCV 4.5 or higher
- Tesseract OCR 4.0 or higher
- Streamlit 1.10 or higher


Acknowledgments

This project uses OpenCV and Tesseract OCR, which are both open-source libraries. The app also uses Streamlit, which is an open-source framework for building web applications.
